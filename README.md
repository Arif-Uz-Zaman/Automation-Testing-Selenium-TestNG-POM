# Automation Testing with Selenium and TestNG using Page Object Model

This repository contains a series of automation test scripts that fulfill the requirements of five tasks. Each task corresponds to a specific set of requirements and is implemented using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The tests are designed to automate various web application scenarios and demonstrate best practices in automation testing.

## Project Structure

This project follows a Maven project structure. It includes dependencies and configuration files necessary for Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.
